  Replace calls to one module function with calls to another in a specific MFA.

  # âš  Replacing calls is generally not recommended as any changes to the underlying
  # code being replaced could break the intended behaviour. It mainly exists to
  # replace NIFs and BIFs (e.g. send) that can't normally be hooked into by
  # replacing the function directly.

  ### Examples

        {CallerModule, :my_fun_1, 1},
        {CalledModule, :some_fun_1, 2},
        {ReplacementModule, :another_fun_1, 2}
